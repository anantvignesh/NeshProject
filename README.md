# NeshProject
This project scrapes information from a publicly available website to present insights about an Oil and Gas company. 
This project was completely developed using Google Colaboratory and for that reason, all the data sets were created, stored and processed in google drive directly.
Since this project was developed in Google Colab, there will be lines of code that involves mounting google drive.
To run this program, you can copy the entire data set in the NeshProject/Nesh folder locally and make modifications accordingly to run the program locally.
This program can also be run using the same google colab by copying the entire data from NeshProject/Nesh folder to your google drive and mounting your drive in the program.
